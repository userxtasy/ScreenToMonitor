# ScreenToMonitor
I will be showing you how to turn a screen into a monitor the easiest and most understanable way possible. 

## Disabling

You will first need to disable your screen from your laptop. Depending on the brand of your laptop you will get a monitor looking like this by the end of the disassembling.

## EDP to HDMI

At the bottom of the screen you will have a LCD cable with his LCD interface. Either on the _cable itself_ or on _the back of the screen_ you will have a sticker 
with a serial number (?im not sure) which should start with B173 and then some random numbers & letters. 

  On Ebay or any other marketplace ( it is more common to find it on Ebay ) search EDP LCD Control Board and your serial number (? still don't know) and you will
  find something looking similar to this :
